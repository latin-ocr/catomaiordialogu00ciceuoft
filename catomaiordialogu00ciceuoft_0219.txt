BIOGRAPHICAL INDEX. 181

Magister Equitum (formal) 13.0. 210. Consul B.0. 205 (col-
league of Africanus). His reputation for legal knowledge
caused him to be elected Pontifex Maximus, though he had
held no curule office,—a thing that had happened only once
for 120 years,—and in opposition to Fulvius Flaccus and
Manlius Torquatus [Liv. 25, 5]. Similarly he was Censor in
13.0. 210, though he had not been Consul, a distinction which
was less uncommon. He was Praetor Peregrinus in 13.c. 208.
When elected Consul he allowed his colleague Scipio to take
the province of Sicily without drawing lots [Liv. 28, 38]. He
himself commanded the army in Bruttium, where towards the
end of the year it was visited with so violent a pestilence that
it had to be disbanded. He himself suffered from the disease
[Liv. 29, 10]. After his year of office he was continued in
command of two legions in Bruttium for another year (6.0.
204), in the course of which he joined his forces with those of
the Consul Sempronius, who had just been worsted in a
skirmish with Hannibal, and the two managed to defeat the
Carthaginien in a battle somewhere near Croton, with consider
able slaughter. Livy [30, 1] describes him as noble, rich,
handsome‚ physically strong, and juris pontificii peritissimus.
He died in 13.c. 183 [Liv. 39, 46].
